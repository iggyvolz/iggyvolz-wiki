It is designed to be extremely simple, and therefore, easily integratable into any existing website.  If you are looking for a more complete wiki software that you can instantly use, try <a href="http://mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a>.  It does not currently include login, you can use your own login system and define the username as $username and permissions as $permission_NAME (TRUE if belongs to user, FALSE if not.  If $permission_NAME is defined as FALSE, no permissions are applied)  It was originally designed for <a href="http://eternityinc-official.com">Eternity Inc.</a>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
Just like many other softwares, Iggyvolz Wiki must be first configured.  Visit the main page and follow the link.  You will be prompted for some information, if you can't find it, you should be able to google it.  Any problems with it, just contact me (iggyvolz@aim.com)
<h2>Configuring the syntax</h2>
Congratulations!  The wiki has been created.  However, only plain text is supported.  No links, no pictures, no font changes.  Pretty boring, right?  Edit the syntax.php file to customize your wiki. (ex. %link% to <a href=" , %begintext% to "> , %endlink% to </a> )  If you want a pre-programmed syntax.php file, check out our <a href="iggyvolzgames.web44.net/iggyvolzwiki?p=list of syntax.php files">list of syntax.php files</a>.
<h3>Write extensions!</h3>
You can customise your wiki even further by writing extensions.  Coming soon!
